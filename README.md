## Presentation
**KeexyBox** allows you to do **parental control**, **block ads**, limit telemetry, and **browse the Internet anonymously** from your home network without installing any software on your devices. It is a software program which requires a [Raspberry PI](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and which is installed on [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). It constitutes a cut-off point between your devices (computers, tablets, smartphones, etc.) and your router or Internet box. KeexyBox acts as a default gateway and DNS server for the devices in your home network.

It thus intercepts all connections to the Internet to carry out website filtering or to activate browsing via the Tor anonymity network according to connection profiles which you have configured.

It does not require any installation on your devices because the filtering is carried out by the DNSs, thus allowing HTTPS sites to be filtered while at the same time protecting the KeexyBox usersâ€™ privacy.
